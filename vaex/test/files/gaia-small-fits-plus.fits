<FIELD datatype="float" name="astrometric_delta_q" ucd="stat.value">
<DESCRIPTION>In the TGAS solution \tt astrometricDeltaQ (\Delta Q) indicates the
discrepancy between the Hipparcos proper motion and the TGAS proper
motion. A large value of \tt deltaQ could indicate non-linear motion
(e.g. in a binary).

The precise definition is

\Delta Q = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\Delta\mu_{\alpha *} &amp; \Delta\mu_{\delta} 
\end{bmatrix}
\left(\vec{C}_\text{pm,\,T}+\vec{C}_\text{pm,\,H}\right)^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix} 
\Delta\mu_{\alpha *} \\ \Delta\mu_{\delta} 
\end{bmatrix}

where \Delta\mu_{\alpha *} = \mu_{\alpha *,\rm T}-\mu_{\alpha *,\rm H},
\Delta\mu_{\delta} = \mu_{\delta,\rm T}-\mu_{\delta,\rm H}, with T and H
indicating values from the Gaia DR1 (TGAS) solution and Hipparcos
catalogue. \vec{C}_\text{pm,\,T} and \vec{C}_\text{pm,\,H} are the
corresponding 2\times 2 covariance matrices.

In order to compute \Delta Q the two sets of proper motions must use the
same reference frame and the same reference epoch. Thus, the proper
motion components as given in the Hipparcos catalogue were rotated to
the Gaia DR1 reference frame, and then propagated to the Gaia reference
epoch.</DESCRIPTION>
</FIELD>
<FIELD datatype="double" name="astrometric_excess_noise" ucd="stat.value" unit="Angle[mas]">
<DESCRIPTION>This is the excess noise \epsilon_i of the source. It measures the
disagreement, expressed as an angle, between the observations of a
source and the best-fitting standard astrometric model (using five
astrometric parameters). The assumed observational noise in each
observation is quadratically increased by \epsilon_i in order to
statistically match the residuals in the astrometric solution. A value
of 0 signifies that the source is astrometrically well-behaved, i.e. 
that the residuals of the fit statistically agree with the assumed
observational noise. A positive value signifies that the residuals are
statistically larger than expected.

The significance of \epsilon_i is given by \tt 
astrometricExcessNoiseSig (D). If D\le 2 then \epsilon_i is probably not
significant, and the source may be astrometrically well-behaved even if
\epsilon_i is large.

The excess noise \epsilon_i may absorb all kinds of modelling errors
that are not accounted for by the observational noise (image centroiding
error) or the excess attitude noise. Such modelling errors include LSF
and PSF calibration errors, geometric instrument calibration errors, and
part of the high-frequency attitude noise. These modelling errors are
particularly important in the early data releases, but should decrease
as the astrometric modelling of the instrument and attitude improves
over the years.

Additionally, sources that deviate from the standard five-parameter
astrometric model (e.g. unresolved binaries, exoplanet systems, etc.)
may have positive \epsilon_i. Given the many other possible
contributions to the excess noise, the user must study the empirical
distributions of \epsilon_i and D to make sensible cutoffs before
filtering out sources for their particular application.

In Gaia DR1, the excess source noise has the same interpretation as
described above for both the primary (TGAS) and secondary data sets. It
measures the disagreement between the five-parameter model and the
observations, augmented by the different priors used. Thus, in TGAS the
excess noise may be increased if the proper motion seen during the 14
months of Gaia observations are not in agreement with the proper motion
inferred from the Tycho-2/Gaia comparison. In the secondary solution the
excess noise may be increased if the Gaia observations indicate a proper
motion or parallax several times larger than the prior uncertainty.

The excess source noise is further explained in Sects. 3.6 and 5.1.2 of
Lindegren et al. (2012).

<FIELD datatype="double" name="astrometric_excess_noise_sig" ucd="stat.value">
<DESCRIPTION>A dimensionless measure (D) of the significance of the calculated \tt 
astrometricExcessNoise (\epsilon_i). A value D&gt;2 indicates that the
given \epsilon_i is probably significant.

For good fits in the limit of a large number of observations, D should
be zero in half of the cases and approximately follow the positive half
of a normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation for
the other half. Consequently, D is expected to be greater than 2 for
only a few percent of the sources with well-behaved astrometric
solutions.

In the early data releases \epsilon_i will however include instrument
and attitude modelling errors that are statistically significant and
could result in large values of \epsilon_i and D. The user must study
the empirical distributions of these statistics and make sensible
cutoffs before filtering out sources for their particular application.

The excess noise significance is further explained in Sect. 5.1.2 of
Lindegren et al. (2012).

<FIELD datatype="int" name="astrometric_priors_used">
<DESCRIPTION>Type of prior used in the astrometric solution:

-   0: No prior used

-   1: Galaxy Bayesian Prior for parallax and proper motion

-   3: Hipparcos prior for position

-   4: Hipparcos prior for position and proper motion

-   5: Tycho2 prior for position

-   6: Quasar prior for proper motion

The Galaxy Bayesian Prior is defined in , where it is denoted
\sigma_{\varpi,F90} (for the parallax) and
\sigma_{\mu,F90}={\cal R}\sigma_{\varpi,F90}, with {\cal 
R}=10 yr^{-1} (for proper motion). The Galaxy Bayesian Prior relaxed by
a factor 10 is 10\sigma_{\varpi,F90} and 10\sigma_{\mu,F90},
respectively.

For Gaia DR1 the only types of priors used are 2 (for the secondary data
set), 3 (for the Hipparcos subset of the primary data set), or 5 (for
the non-Hipparcos subset of the primary data set). Type 6 was used for
internal calibration purposes and alignment of the reference frame, but
the corresponding astrometric results are in general not published.</DESCRIPTION>

<FIELD datatype="boolean" name="duplicated_source">
<DESCRIPTION>During data processing, this source happened to been duplicated and one
source only has been kept. This may indicate observational,
cross-matching or processing problems, or stellar multiplicity, and
probable astrometric or photometric problems in all cases. In DR1, for
close doubles with separations below some 2 arcsec, truncated windows
have not been processed, neither in astrometry and photometry. The
transmitted window is centred on the brighter part of the acquired
window, so the brighter component has a better chance to be selected,
even when processing the fainter transit. If more than two images are
contained in a window, the result of the image parameter determination
is un-predictable in the sense that it might refer to either (or
neither) image, and no consistency is assured.</DESCRIPTION>

<FIELD datatype="float" name="scan_direction_strength_k1">
<DESCRIPTION>The scanDirectionStrength and scanDirectionMean quantify the
distribution of AL scan directions across the source.
scanDirectionStrength[k-1] (k=1,2,3,4) is the absolute value of the
trigonometric moments m_k=\langle\exp(ik\theta)\rangle, where \theta is
the position angle of the scan and the mean value is taken over the
nObs[0] AL observations contributing to the astrometric parameters of
the source. \theta is defined in the usual astronomical sense: \theta=0
when the FoV is moving towards local North, and \theta=90^\circ towards
local East.

The scanDirectionStrength is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means
that the scan directions are well spread out in different directions,
while 1 means that they are concentrated in a single direction (given by
scanAngleMean).

The different orders k are statistics of the scan directions modulo
360^\circ/k. For example, at first order (k=1), \theta=10^\circ and
\theta=190^\circ count as different directions, but at second order
(k=2) they are the same. Thus, scanDirectionStrength[0] is the degree of
concentration when the sense of direction is taken into account, while
scanDirectionStrength[1] is the degree of concentration without regard
to the sense of direction. A large value of scanDirectionStrength[3]
indicates that the scans are concentrated in two nearly orthogonal
directions.</DESCRIPTION>

The value for ph_qual is set for a band according to the precedence of
the table below. For example, a source that is tested and meets the
conditions for category “X” is not tested for subsequent qualities.

-   “X” - There is a detection at this location, but no valid brightness
    estimate can be extracted using any algorithm. Default magnitude is
    null.

-   “U” - Upper limit on magnitude. Source is not detected in this band,
    or it is detected, but not resolved in a consistent fashion with
    other bands. A value of ph_qual=“U” does not necessarily mean that
    there is no flux detected in this band at the location.

-   “F” - This category includes sources where a reliable estimate of
    the photometric error could not be determined. The uncertainties
    reported for these sources in [jhk]_msigcom are flags and have
    numeric values &gt;8.0.

-   “E” - This category includes detections where the goodness-of-fit
    quality of the profile-fit photometry was very poor, or detections
    where psf fit photometry did not converge and an aperture magnitude
    is reported, or detections where the number of frames was too small
    in relation to the number of frames in which a detection was
    geometrically possible.

-   “A” - Detections in any brightness regime where valid measurements
    were made with [jhk]_snr&gt;10 AND [jhk]_cmsig&lt;0.10857.

-   “B” - Detections in any brightness regime where valid measurements
