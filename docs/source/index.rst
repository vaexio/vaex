Vaex: Interactive visualization and exploration of more than a billion objects
==============================================================================




What is Vaex?
=============

* Vaex is a **program** and **python library** to visualize and explore large tabular datasets.
* It mainly renders **histograms**, **density plots** and **volume rendering**  plots for visualization in the order of a **billion** (10\ :sup:`9`) objects in the order of **1 second**.
* *Statistics* such as mean, sum, count, standard deviation etc, can all be calculated on an *N-dimensional grid*.
* For **exploration** it support selection in 1 and 2d, but it can also analyse the columns (dimensions) to find subspaces which are richer in information than others.
* **Downloads**: :doc:`Standalone version or Python package <installing>`
* **More**: :doc:`gallery` | :doc:`program` | :doc:`Tutorial <tutorial_ipython_notebook>` | :doc:`API docs <api>` | :doc:`examples`

Main features
=============

* The vaex graphical interface

    * Visualize a **billion** (10\ :sup:`9`) rows **interactively** in a graphics interface in 1d (**histogram**), 2d (**density plot**) and 3d (**volume rendering**)
    * Overplot **vectors**, for instance mean motions, **tensors** (for instance mean velocity dispersion tensor)
    * **Custom expressions**, e.g. log(sqrt(x**2+y**2)), calculated on the fly
    * publish quality output (using **matplotlib**)
    * Linked views:  selecting in 1 view will also select it in different views
    * data formats

     * **hdf5**: gadget, our own format (in the future: other formats can be supported with a few lines of code)
     * hdf5 from `Amuse <http://amusecode.org/>`_.
     * fits bintable
     * VOtable over SAMP
     * gadget native format

    * Ranking of subspaces: for 2 and 3 dimensional subspaces, a ranking can be calculated that indicates the relative richness of structure and/or correlation in them.
    * Easily showing a fraction of the data: if the rows are uncorrelated in order (random order), a subset of the data can be shown using a slider (which can make the program more responsive)
    * exporting data: the selected data can be exported for further analysis
    * undo/redo: a mistake in selection or navigation can quickly be undone using undo

* The vaex library
 * Generate the same plots and more as the graphical interface
 * Integration with IPython notebook

Getting started
===============


If you want to try out vaex as a graphical tool only, :ref:`download the binary <installing_from_binary>` and read the :ref:`quickstart <quickstart>`.

If you want to use vaex as a library, from your script or IPython notebook, :ref:`install vaex as a library <installing_from_source>`, and go through the :ref:`tutorial`.
