    "\n",
    "- Binary file formats:\n",

    "     - Python dictionaries\n",
    "     \n",
    "The following examples show the best practices of getting your data in Vaex.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is already in one of the supported binary file formats (HDF5, Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet, FITS), opening it with Vaex rather simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import vaex \n",
    "\n",
    "df_1 = vaex.open('./my_data/my_file_1.hdf5')\n",
    "df_2 = vaex.open('./my_data/my_file_1.arrow')\n",
    "df_3 = vaex.open('./my_data/my_file_1.parquet')\n",
    "df_4 = vaex.open('./my_data/my_file_1.fits')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening such data is instantenous regardless of the file size on disk: Vaex will just memory-map the data instead of reading it in memory. This is the optimal way of working with large datasets that are larger than available RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is contained within multiple files, one can open them all simultaneously like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.open('./my_data/my_file*.hdf5')\n",
    "# alternatively\n",
    "df = vaex.open_many(['./my_data/my_file_1.hdf5', './my_data/my_file_2.hdf5', './my_data/my_file_2.hdf5'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "The result will be a single DataFrame object containing all of the data coming from all files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets one is trying to open do not necessarily have to be local. With Vaex you can open a HDF5 file straight from Amazon's S3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.open('s3://vaex/taxi/yellow_taxi_2009_2015_f32.hdf5?anon=true')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the data will be lazily downloaded and cached to your local machine. \"Lazily downloaded\" means that Vaex will only download the portions of the data you really need. For example: imagine that we have a file hosted on S3 that has 100 columns and 1 billion rows. Getting a preview of the DataFrame via `print(df)` for instance will download only the first and last 5 rows of that data. If we than proceed making calculations or plots with only 5 columns, only the data from those columns will be downloaded and caches to our local machine. This approaches saves us bothbandwith and local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text based file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "Datasets are still commonly stored in text-based file formats such as CSV. Since text-based file formats are not memory-mappable, they have to be read in memory. If the contents of a CSV file fits into the available RAM memory, one can simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.from_csv('./my_data/my_file.csv')\n",
    "# or alternatively \n",
    "df = vaex.read_csv('./my_data/my_file.csv')  # `vaex.read_csv` is an alias to `vaex.from_csv`\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaex is using pandas for reading CSV files in the background, so one can pass any arguments to the `vaex.from_csv` or `vaex.read_csv` as one would pass to `pandas.read_csv` and specify for example separators, column names and column types for instance. In addition to this, if you specify the `convert=True` argument `vaex.from_csv` the data will be automatically converted to an HDF5 file format behind the scenes, and thus freeing RAM and allowing you to work with your data in a memory-efficient, out-of-core manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the CSV file is so large that it can not fit into RAM all at one time, one can convert the data to HDF5 simply by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.from_csv('./my_data/my_big_file.csv', convert=True, chunk_size=5_000_000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the above line is executed, Vaex will read the CSV in chunks, and convert each chunk to a temporary HDF5 file on disk. All temporary will files are then concatenated into a single HDF5, and the temporary files deleted. The size of the individual chunks to be read can be specified via the `chunk_size` argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also common the data to be stored in JSON files. To read such data in Vaex one can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.from_json('./my_data/my_file.json')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a convenience method and simply wraps `pandas.read_json`, so the same arguments and file reading strategy applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-memory data representations\n",
    "\n",
    "One can construct a Vaex DataFrame from a variety of in-memory data representations. One of the most useful such operations is converting a pandas into Vaex DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.from_pandas(pandas_df, copy_index=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `copy_index` argument specifies whether the index column of a pandas DataFrame should be imported into the Vaex DataFrame. Converting a pandas into a Vaex DataFrame is particularly useful since pandas can read data from a large variety of file formats. For instance, if we want to work with a [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) file, we can read it into Vaex via pandas like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import vaex\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas_df = pd.read_sas('./my_data/my_file.xport')\n",
    "df = vaex.from_pandas(pandas_df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can read in an [arrow table](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html) as a DataFrame in a similar manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df = vaex.from_arrow_table(pa_table)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a Vaex DataFrame from numpy arrays can be done line this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import vaex\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "x = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "y = np.array(['dog', 'cat', 'mouse'])\n",
    "\n",
    "df = vaex.from_arrays(x=x, y=y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a DataFrame from a Python dict is also straight-forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "d = {'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse']}\n",
    "df = vaex.from_dict(d)\n",
    "```"

    "### Binary file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient way to store data on disk when you work with Vaex is to use binary file formats. Vaex can export a DataFrame to HDF5, Apache Arrow, Apache Parquet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df.export_hdf5('./my_output_data/data.hdf5')\n",
    "df.export_arrow('./my_output_data/data.arrow')\n",

    "df.export_fits('./my_output_data/data.fits')\n",

    "Alternatively, one can simply use\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df.export('./my_output_data/data.hdf5')\n",
    "df.export('./my_output_data/data.arrow')\n",
    "df.export('./my_output_data/data.parquet')\n",
    "df.export('./my_output_data/data.fits')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where Vaex will determine the file format of the based on the specified extension of the file name. If the extension is not recognized, an exception will be raised. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is large, i.e. larger than the available RAM, we recomment exporting to HDF5. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Text based file format\n",
    "\n",
    "At times, it may be useful to export the data to disk in a text based file format such as CSV. In that case one can simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "df.export_csv('./my_output_data/data.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `df.export_csv` method is using `pandas_df.to_csv` behind the scenes, and thus one can pass any argument to `df.export_csv` as would to `pandas_df.to_csv`. The data is exported in chunks and the size of those chunks can be specified by the `chunk_size` argument in `df.export_csv`. In this way, data that is too large to fit in RAM can be saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In memory data representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a rich ecosystem comprised of various libraries for data manupulation, that offer different functionality. Thus it is often useful to be able to pass data from one library to another. Vaex is able to pass on its data to other libraries via a number of in-memory representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DataFrame representations\n",
    "\n",
    "A vaex DataFrame can be converted to a pandas DataFrame like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pandas_df = df.to_pandas_df()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For DataFrames that are too large to fit in memory, one can specify the `chunk_size` argument, and the `df.to_pandas_df(chunk_size=100_000)` returns an generator yileding a pandas DataFrame with as many rows as indicated by the `chunk_size` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting a Vaex DataFrame into an arrow table is similar:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Get a single arrow table\n",
    "table = df.to_arrow_table()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a generator, yielding an arrow table with the specified number of rows\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A Vaex DataFrame can be lazily exposed as a Dask array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ddf = df.to_dask_array()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping it close to pure Python, one can export a Vaex DataFrame as a dictionary:\n",

    "# Get a single Python dict\n",
    "d_dict = df.to_dict()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a generator, yielding a Python dict with the specified number of rows\n",
    "gen = df.to_dict(chunk_size=1_000_000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, one can also convert a DataFrame to a list of tuples, were the first element of the tuple is the column name, while the second element is the array representation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Get a single item list\n",
